>RFM clustering (Revenue, Frequency and Monetary value based clustering)
<br>
1. Visualise and explore data in the Dataset (fields such as Customer details, inovice dates, order value, quantity etc.)<br>
2. Divide people into clusters so that we can make customised strategies for each person.<br>
3. Clusters to be made based on Recency, Frequency and Revenue. So make different clusters on the basis of the 3 parameters.<br>
4. Calculate an overall cluster on the basis of the 3 clusters. <br>
5. We can then have different strategies for different clusters by studying the characteristics of the clusters.<br>
