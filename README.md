* Visualise and explore data in the Dataset. Dataset containe fields such as Customer details, inovice dates, order value, quantity etc.
* Divide people into clusters so that we can make customised strategies for each person.
* Clusters to be made based on Recency, Frequency and Revenue. So make different clusters on the basis of the 3 parameters.
* Calculate an overall cluster on the basis of the 3 clusters. 
* We can then have different strategies for different clusters by studying the characteristics of the clusters.
